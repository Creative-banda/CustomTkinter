fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    
    
# Explanation:
# We use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list fruits.
# The variable fruit takes the value of each element in the list one by one.
# In this case, it will print each fruit in the list: "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
