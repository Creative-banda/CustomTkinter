# List of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Iterate over each fruit in the list and print it
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

"""
Explanation:
-------------
We use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list 'fruits'.
The variable 'fruit' takes the value of each element in the list one by one.
In this case, it will print each fruit in the list: "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
