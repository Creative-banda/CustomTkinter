# Example 3: Class with a Simple Method

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number  # Store the number in the object

    def double(self):
        result = self.number * 2
        print(f"Double of {self.number} is {result}")

# Create an instance of Calculator with number 5
calc = Calculator(5)
calc.double()

"""
Key Takeaways:

- self.number stores the number.
- double() uses that data to do something with it.
- self is always the first parameter of any class method to let the method access or modify the objectâ€™s own data.

Final Key Point: Why self?

- self is a nickname for the object. You can think of it like:
    When you call calc.double(), Python does this:
        Calculator.double(calc)
    So self is calc here.
